In episode seven the concept of manipulation was considered and is revisited in this episode. Terry’s manipulation of Eddie is dressed in the role play of a fledgling sado-masochistic relationship but as will become evident, a key element of such role plays – trust – is brutally betrayed. Jess continues to raise concerns with hospital management and finds herself silenced, admonished and betrayed by those who she should have been able to trust, working to hidden agendas.
