The concluding episode of Shadow draws upon a real-life experience of the author.

Staff in top security environments are advised to take care in the kinds of personal information shared with patients. ‘Escapes’ from such environments are largely the creation of fiction and are very rare events but of course, patients do leave the hospital as sections come to an end or treatments suggests more community based services may be suitable for on-going care needs. Staff are asked to consider whether they wish patients who may one day leave the hospital to know their home address, or the schools of their children. This is not a judgement on the patients who may have been successfully treated for their condition, but a recognition that patients relapse and may seek revenge for their perceived wrongs at the hands of staff in the hospitals. The last thing any staff member wants is a psychopath visiting them at home….
