I know two of my my characters like I know myself - I have known them for years as the idea for my one-day-to-be-written novel has grown up in a cranny somewhere behind my front temporal lobe. &nbsp;I can see both in my minds eye: Both have characteristics I like such as the slim hips of one (predictably shallow of me) or the fierce tenacity in the face of extreme challenge of my lead female. &nbsp;I know what they wear, what they eat, their loves and their histories. &nbsp;So far so good. <br /><br />But what about the others? &nbsp;I was asked the other day if there would be any black characters in my story. &nbsp;In the setting in which my story takes place it would be careless if there were not. &nbsp;Clearly real authors write as 'other' all the time - women write in the voice of male characters and vice versa, some write as members of the Glubon race from the planet Xaniiita in languages set in the year 3027. &nbsp;Sometimes it works gloriously and sometimes it is painful. &nbsp;I am slightly afraid of this part of the task and so want to get it right. &nbsp;Something to think more about ........<br /><br />Then of course there is the issue of lesbian or gay characters. &nbsp;One of my lead women is lesbian and this is incidental. &nbsp;In books with straight characters there is never any kind of explanation or back story related to their being straight so I don't intend there to be for 'Jess' but will this lead to a clunky void in the narrative? &nbsp;I guess I need to see how this goes.
