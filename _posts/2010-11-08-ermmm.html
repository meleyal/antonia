I ran out of words today. That was unexpected. &nbsp;I went to my keyboard and had no idea what I was going to write next. &nbsp;This hasn't happened so far so it was a bit scary. &nbsp;I had two days of not being able to write much because of having (the most excellent) house guests for the weekend. &nbsp;Today, work was very demanding and due to an also unexpected visit to the vets with one of my dogs, couldn't write before work so I had to start at 8pm which is not a good time for me to write. I write better in the morning. &nbsp;Was I in a panic? Was it because I had taken a short break and lost momentum? &nbsp;I don't know but I was definitely without mojo! I decided to introduce a psychopathic gangster to the story. &nbsp;I met one once, and he was a monster of a man so thinking about that got me back on a roll. I also introduced a fledgeling romance for the main character - I hadn't planned to but that popped into my head. Like the gangster, I have some experience with romance, as well so I am hoping this gives word count even if the structure of the whole thing is getting as lunatic as the psychiatric hospital in which it is set.<br />Of course I don't mean 'lunatic', I mean 'challenged'.<br /><br />Have hit 20k words, 20080 to be precise. &nbsp;Feels like a good count, except I read on the NaNo site that five people have finished already. &nbsp;Obviously, they don't have real jobs. Show offs.
