Today I needed to be in London all day. &nbsp;At my meeting a colleague asked if I had ever gotten round to that novel writing thing. I said I had. He asked 'so have you made up characters and stuff'. &nbsp;I told him I now had a huge number of imaginary friends and I would rather be playing with them than be at the meeting. &nbsp;It was true. I have been thinking about plot all day (funnily enough, much more interesting than workload modelling) and perhaps because I couldn't do any writing during my best writing hours of 6-9am (because of travelling to London) my mind was free to work on more detail about what is going to happen in whats left of the book. &nbsp;I know roughly what is going to happen and I am going to get out of the way and let my imagination write it. &nbsp;Exciting and still fun.<br /><br />On the train home a chap was typing on a Mac book and listening to tunes on his Iphone. Every now and again, for over an hour he whistled three notes. &nbsp;Doh-ray-me. &nbsp;That's all - just those three notes, and at a range of spaces over an hour and a half. He didn't know he was doing it. &nbsp;I noticed it and expect it will find a way into a book at some point.<br /><br />I also found, hidden away in my head, the first line of my next book. <br /><br />So, it was an unexpectedly productive day. &nbsp;I also managed to write another couple of thousand words this evening. &nbsp;Current word count 22122. &nbsp;Nearly half way! &nbsp;Better get on with the next mysterious demise of a patient.......
