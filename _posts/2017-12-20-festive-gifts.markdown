It is that time of year - the time of gifts and peace and joy to all beings.  

I was fortunate enough to have participated in the Greenham Women's Peace camp movement many years ago.  I was a very small contributor and had neither the fortitude or endurance of the many amazing women who lived in cold, wet and scary conditions so that the rest of us could sleep a little more peacefully in our beds without the threat of nuclear holocaust hanging over us.  These courageous women made a difference to the world.

I had the opportunity to write something which drew upon my experiences of being at Greenham.  The story 'For the Common Good' over on my 'work in progress' page is the outcome.  I offer it as a festive seasonal gift to readers.  Enjoy.
