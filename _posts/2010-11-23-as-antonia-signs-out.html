<div class="MsoNormal">I’ll be back</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">In the words of Schwarzenegger ‘I’ll be back’ but who exactly will be back and where?</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Well Antoinia Chain will be back for sure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I’ve always been fond of my alter ego. She is much more glamorous than me (hard to believe I know…erm….) and is as cool as you like (and slimmer, natch).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But she is going on an extended holiday, probably I imagine first class on the Orient Express, until, perhaps July 2011. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Then she will return, take the 50k words we have drafted together and really work at making it into the kind of novel I will get the no doubt demoralising job of hawking around to see if there is a market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>At the very least I intend to turn it into the kind of draft I want to show people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Everyone who has ever written a ditty on their Aunties birthday card believes they can write.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They can’t but often we are all too nice to say so. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>I know I can.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Arrogant or what? Whatever!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I have absolutely learned through NaNo that I can write good stuff to read and I am going to really give some time, commitment and energy to developing the craft that real ‘authorship’ is …but not yet.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Does anyone remember the Monty Python sketch – “you think you had it bad?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I lived in a cardboard box and ate badgers for tea!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Funny but I hate with a passion those ‘oh my life was so dreadful and yet despite the beatings/drugs/lack of a footballer husband I made it’ books that swamp the bestsellers so I will avoid the slippery slope here but if I write it quickly and you read it quickly maybe it wont seem too maudlin?</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Writing the book was a way to make myself feel better after making an almighty calamity of another, much more important book I was writing: My Doctoral thesis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In the context of increasing physical disability over the past six years (oh gawd, here come the damn violins), and a busy full time job, I just couldn’t seem to apply myself to the writing up of my research and time moved on. I felt so utterly stupid and downhearted about making such a mess of it, and if truth be told, pretty crappy about the loss of so much of the me I used to be as the brain lesions took hold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Confidence/self esteem utterly and deeply in the toilet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The novel writing challenge success gave me courage to call it a day on the doctorate, walk out with my research Masters, let the bloody albatross hung heavy round my neck go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yesterday I went to see my thesis supervisors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I walked out of the meeting re-registered with a plan to submit in April 2011.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Looks like Dr Antonia Chain (pending) may be back as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>(not counting chickens but 90% of it is already written and I am SO going to give it the effort and energy I gave to NaNo).</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">What I have learned is documented in the blog.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was a lot. For anyone that might be thinking of doing it next year (do it!) Chris Baty’s book <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">No plot, no problem </i>is excellent and so true. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Obviously I need to do a Gwynneth Paltrow and tearfully and expansively thank people before I print off the pages as a keep sake and shut this blog down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Firstly my lovely son who told me about the NaNo challenge in the first place. You have no idea what you gave me but it was precious and amazing and I want to give you it back!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You have been known to lean on the side of procrastination yourself so do the challenge with me next year. Xx</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">I have had just over 2000 hits on the blog which isn’t bad for something that has been up just 23 days and only ‘promoted’ on my own FB page.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I have family/friend readers in the <st1:country-region w:st="on">UK</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Austria</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Japan</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sweden</st1:place></st1:country-region> – thanks to all for the lovely comments and support.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I appreciate it more than you know. </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">More amazingly (and I still don’t know how) I have followers in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">New  Zealand</st1:country-region>, The States (hi again <st1:state w:st="on">Alaska</st1:state>) and <st1:country-region w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region> (wow, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:place></st1:country-region>!) - that is just so amazingly fabulous I don’t know what to say – and all of these stopped by regularly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The internet is incredible eh?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Thanks so much for the interest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Fellow NaNites from the Brighton and <st1:place w:st="on">Hove</st1:place> crew. You are all magical and lovely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Thanks to Sara (we share a love of the genre) who was in the back of my head when I was writing the gory bits – was it gory <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">enough</i> for her?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And Sam for the inspiration for a section on knotwork.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Just to be clear, should the book ever actually make the shelves, no-one else was inspiration for nothing, nada, zilch, zero &nbsp;- OK? &nbsp;No one I know is a deadly psychopath, truly, it isn’t you. Honestly.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Obviously undying thanks and love and squishy cuddly soppy stuff and adoration to my glorious missus who read drafts even though they gave her nightmares. I will pay for the counselling out of my first royalties love.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Cath I love you. Always and forever. &nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">So, was it looney tunes that signed off with ‘that’s all folks’?</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Every best wish, </div><div class="MsoNormal">Antonia Chain
