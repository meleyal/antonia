Well, having never so much as even seen a 'blog' creator before its been a bit of a challenge to set this up. &nbsp;I want to post various things to it but haven't worked out how yet. &nbsp;Bear with me. &nbsp;There is more to it than immediately meets the eye: background templates - should I go for mean and moody or bright and chipper? &nbsp;should the template reflect who I think Antonia is or who I am? &nbsp;Should the template reflect the kind of dark thriller I hope to write? &nbsp;Don't even get me started on the font! &nbsp;The biggest question I need to face right now is whether setting up this blog is just a form of procrastination from actually starting the novel writing planning? &nbsp;Hmmm.
