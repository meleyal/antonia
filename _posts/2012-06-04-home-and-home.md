This week I have moved home and it is very hard work!  Boxes are everywhere and I wonder when I will ever get my office as set up and sorted as I have been used to.  Making decisions about where items are going to 'live' and sadly discovering that something which looked just right in the last house looks just wrong in this one is exhausting. It is also a little bit demoralising even though I chose to move and was excited when it actually happened.  So, very tired last night I turned to my much neglected email and discovered that one of my short stories has been accepted for a new anthology.  It was exactly the pick up I needed and, coincidentally, the story is called 'Home'.

More details to follow as soon as the contract is signed. For now though, I am feeling happy about both 'homes'.
