<p>Where I come from there is an expression ‘<em>keeping your ear out’ </em>– it is the aural equivalent of keeping ones eyes open.</p>
<p>Yesterday on the train I heard two wonderfully comic and evocative bits of dialogue</p>
<p><em>“He had the biggest baby blue eyes.  He is thirty now.  His eyes are still blue of course, but more in proportion”.</em></p>
<p>And…</p>
<p><em>“I was on the radio once. I was making chutney.  I still have the tape”.</em></p>
<p>I couldn’t see the woman who was making these comments – she was sat behind me - but she was just chatting, not trying to be comic and there was absolutely no irony in her voice.</p>
<p>Both of these snippets open doors to short stories. I feel that I could easily build hundreds of words around each.  Or, alternatively, they are pieces of dialogue I might slip into a bigger piece of work.  They would add depth because there is something about them so <em>real.  </em>(I could hear each appearing in an Alan Bennett monologue for example).</p>
<p>They could be used to build character.  What kind of woman speaks like this?  What does she look like?  What is her life like?  I have a picture in my head of who she is though I never saw her.  Getting a character to have depth means attention to how she speaks and the kinds of words she says.  I feel I could build a whole character just from these lovely snippets of overheard conversation.</p>
<p>Sitting on that train yesterday and hearing this woman, I was reminded again of how important it is for writers to ‘keep our ear open’.</p>
<p>I was also very glad that my home town has this funny expression and wondered – is it local to Yorkshire or common elsewhere?</p>
