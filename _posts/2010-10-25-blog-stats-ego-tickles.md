Hmmm I only have six official followers (so far) but this blogger platform allows one to see stats: Although this blog has only been up for less than a week, and that I have only told about 20 people of its existence I had 129 'hits' on the page yesterday.  Readers were from the USA, Australia, Japan, Austria and the UK. This is strangely exhilarating  and I can see, potentially addictive.  I suddenly understand the whole blogging thing a lot more than I did just a short while ago. It tickles the ego marvellously.  129* people who are interested in what I have to say!  On the other hand... only six followers.......

(* I know some of them fell in here by accident...)
