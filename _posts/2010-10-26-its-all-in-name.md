Yesterday I was pondering titles.  I ferreted a title away years ago for use at a future time but it isn't right for this venture so I started again.... Cath felt it wasn't important, that it would come later but I feel that it is something to hang the book on, to give it a frame.  I created a few but they were obtuse or clumsy or even worse, already taken!  A quick checking out via Amazon evidenced that all my great (!) ideas had already been done, so back to the drawing board. It is harder to find something meaningful but original than one imagines.  What eventually happened is that my working title came to me in my sleep:  The novel has a tentative working title of "The Shadow of the Wing"..
