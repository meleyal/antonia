This is a useful resource for people interested in writing short fiction - especially flash fiction for women's magazines.  Whether I have considered magazine submissions or not, the site has certainly prompted some useful ideas for writing exercises.  I hope you find it useful too.  [http://womagwriter.blogspot.co.uk/](http://womagwriter.blogspot.co.uk/)
