I read and analyse a lot of very important worthy documents for a living. &nbsp;When I read for pleasure I read trash - well written trash but the awards tend to be 'scariest horrid scene' rather than Orange. &nbsp;The founder of NaNoWiMo, Chris Baty suggests that everyone taking the challenge should consider their own 'Magna Carta' - what to me, makes a good novel? &nbsp;The genre I have chosen is the psychological thriller. &nbsp;In prep for the writing month of November I am thinking about what my story has to be - and what it mustn't be. &nbsp; Thinking about this brings to mind a woman I share books with - we love the trash psycho-thriller genre but we both have some wants of our reads and one of them is that the protagonists must be truly insane and unspeakably unpleasant. &nbsp;ZW, I will try not to disappoint. &nbsp;I absolutely promise no weighty moral themes set in Tudor England.
