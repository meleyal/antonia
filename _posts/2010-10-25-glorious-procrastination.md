Yesterday I had several novel related tasks

*   write up some more character biogs
*   draw a location map
*   do the plot timeline

I did none of them - we had unexpected visitors, later a fine bottle of good red to go with the divine risotto cooked by Cath, later still a bit of facebook waffle to catch up on but..... I still did my blog.  Is the blog just a way of _thinking_ about and enjoying the plans for the novel without actually doing it?  I guess I will know that on 1st November when the word count actually starts.  I have NaNoWiMo buddies on the website...guess I need to mosey over there and see if they also have cleaner windows, or a newly decorated bathroom or any other evidences of finding really important other things to do, or...... is that just more procrastination on my part?
