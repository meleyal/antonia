Well, having never so much as even seen a 'blog' creator before its been a bit of a challenge to set this up.  I want to post various things to it but haven't worked out how yet.  Bear with me.  There is more to it than immediately meets the eye: background templates - should I go for mean and moody or bright and chipper?  should the template reflect who I think Antonia is or who I am?  Should the template reflect the kind of dark thriller I hope to write?  Don't even get me started on the font!  The biggest question I need to face right now is whether setting up this blog is just a form of procrastination from actually starting the novel writing planning?  Hmmm.
