I have had to put a hold on posting recently as 'post house move' life caught up and demanded time and energy being spent elsewhere.  However, various friends and colleagues have expressed interest and indeed impatience in seeing my new site so somewhat earlier than expected I am launching it today.

There is much to do!  I haven't even begun to work on my 'true crime' section yet and intend my first posts to be on Harold Shipman and Beverley Allitt (I will explain why when I post) but for now, I hope there is enough to keep readers going.  If you are interested in both true crime, and reflections on writing crime, do follow!  It will be lovely getting to know you....
