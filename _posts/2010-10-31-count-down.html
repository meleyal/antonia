Tomorrow is writing day one and a scary day. I think I have the prologue and at least part of chapter one in my head already but will this translate to 2-3 thousand words or will I end up writing a few sentences and then get stuck? &nbsp;I guess I will know tomorrow.<br /><br />A few writers have told of how their characters surprised them by taking the story and running with it, the character leading and the author typing. Alice Walker, speaks of <i>The Colour Purple</i>&nbsp;being sent to her by her ancestors and describes herself as a conduit rather than the author. &nbsp;Last night, when asleep a whole stack of ideas about my main character came to me - I now know how she came to be in the job she is in &nbsp;in this book, her previous jobs, her training, and her whole back story. &nbsp;This is such an extraordinary experience - I wonder why I have never given my imagination permission to just create before. &nbsp;That being said, I was tired out this morning and wonder if I spent too much time with 'Jess' last night!<br /><br />Today, of all days, is not the day to become MS (pain) symptomatic but that's what has happened. I hurt a lot and feel exhausted beyond measure. &nbsp;If that reads like a get-out clause... well, its the exact opposite. &nbsp;The MS has already had more than I wanted it to have and its not bloody having this adventure! <br /><br />From tomorrow, the book will be my writing priority but I hope to continue to diary the process.<br /><br />Wish me luck - I know I am going to need it!
