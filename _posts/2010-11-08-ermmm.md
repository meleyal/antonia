I ran out of words today. That was unexpected.  I went to my keyboard and had no idea what I was going to write next.  This hasn't happened so far so it was a bit scary.  I had two days of not being able to write much because of having (the most excellent) house guests for the weekend.  Today, work was very demanding and due to an also unexpected visit to the vets with one of my dogs, couldn't write before work so I had to start at 8pm which is not a good time for me to write. I write better in the morning.  Was I in a panic? Was it because I had taken a short break and lost momentum?  I don't know but I was definitely without mojo! I decided to introduce a psychopathic gangster to the story.  I met one once, and he was a monster of a man so thinking about that got me back on a roll. I also introduced a fledgeling romance for the main character - I hadn't planned to but that popped into my head. Like the gangster, I have some experience with romance, as well so I am hoping this gives word count even if the structure of the whole thing is getting as lunatic as the psychiatric hospital in which it is set.
Of course I don't mean 'lunatic', I mean 'challenged'.

Have hit 20k words, 20080 to be precise.  Feels like a good count, except I read on the NaNo site that five people have finished already.  Obviously, they don't have real jobs. Show offs.
