Yesterday I had several novel related tasks<br /><br /><ul><li>write up some more character biogs</li><li>draw a location map</li><li>do the plot timeline</li></ul>I did none of them - we had unexpected visitors, later a fine bottle of good red to go with the divine risotto cooked by Cath, later still a bit of facebook waffle to catch up on but..... I still did my blog. &nbsp;Is the blog just a way of <i>thinking </i>about and enjoying the plans for the novel without actually doing it? &nbsp;I guess I will know that on 1st November when the word count actually starts. &nbsp;I have NaNoWiMo buddies on the website...guess I need to mosey over there and see if they also have cleaner windows, or a newly decorated bathroom or any other evidences of finding really important other things to do, or...... is that just more procrastination on my part?
