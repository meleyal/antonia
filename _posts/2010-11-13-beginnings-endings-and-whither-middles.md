During a dog walk today the end of my story came to me in a frazzle of jangly dramatics and explanations. I know the whys and wherefores, the red herrings and the twists and turns. Some bad characters show how very bad they are and some other redeem themselves.  All good stuff. There are a few chapters in that.  Trouble is, not quite sure how I am going to get there...... a bit of middle missing somewhere. So, I just wrote.  Only a bit because a baked camembert is calling me but I will be back tomorrow, hopefully with some more ideas or I may need to go back to that unbelievable romance.
