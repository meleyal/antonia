Where I come from there is an expression "_keeping your ear out_" – it is the aural equivalent of keeping ones eyes open.

Yesterday on the train I heard two wonderfully comic and evocative bits of dialogue

> "He had the biggest baby blue eyes.  He is thirty now.  His eyes are still blue of course, but more in proportion".

And…

> "I was on the radio once. I was making chutney.  I still have the tape".

I couldn"t see the woman who was making these comments – she was sat behind me - but she was just chatting, not trying to be comic and there was absolutely no irony in her voice.

Both of these snippets open doors to short stories. I feel that I could easily build hundreds of words around each.  Or, alternatively, they are pieces of dialogue I might slip into a bigger piece of work.  They would add depth because there is something about them so _real_.  _(I could hear each appearing in an Alan Bennett monologue for example)_.

They could be used to build character.  What kind of woman speaks like this?  What does she look like?  What is her life like?  I have a picture in my head of who she is though I never saw her.  Getting a character to have depth means attention to how she speaks and the kinds of words she says.  I feel I could build a whole character just from these lovely snippets of overheard conversation.

Sitting on that train yesterday and hearing this woman, I was reminded again of how important it is for writers to "keep our ear open".

I was also very glad that my home town has this funny expression and wondered – is it local to Yorkshire or common elsewhere?
