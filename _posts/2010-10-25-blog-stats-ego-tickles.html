Hmmm I only have six official followers (so far) but this blogger platform allows one to see stats: Although this blog has only been up for less than a week, and that I have only told about 20 people of its existence I had 129 'hits' on the page yesterday. &nbsp;Readers were from the USA, Australia, Japan, Austria and the UK. This is strangely exhilarating &nbsp;and I can see, potentially addictive. &nbsp;I suddenly understand the whole blogging thing a lot more than I did just a short while ago. It tickles the ego marvellously. &nbsp;129* people who are interested in what I have to say! &nbsp;On the other hand... only six followers.......<br /><br /><br />(* I know some of them fell in here by accident...)
