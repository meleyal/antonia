NaNoWriMo - the National Novel Writing Month - begins again in November.  NaNoWriMo is a challenge to write a book in a month.  To be more accurate it is to write 50k words in a month, so novella rather than a full, actual novel.  It works out at about 2k words a day and that is quite a challenge for many writers. It can feel like very hard work - even if the story one is trying to tell is exciting.  

Why chose to do it? Lots of writers - including well established, published and/or full-time scribes enjoy the challenge of both the task and of joining up with the community of other writers which, through the NaNo website, is always lively, fun and supportive.  I find it great fun and have 'won' NaNo (to use the terminology of the experience) three times but tried to do it a couple more time than that - and those novels didn't work out.  It was all great experience.

This year I am writing completely out of genre.  I am writing a coming of age story but for a woman nearing her 60's and I am telling it in the first person.  I hope it will be wry, interesting and good writing.  Wish me luck. I am very unsure about this one, but hey - it is always an adventure.
